# Get Linux-Process IDs
Module for C/C++ to find process-id numbers of current running linux-processes.

- Can be used to prevent multiple process instances on Linux instead of creating PID-files.
- Similar to the shell-command "pidof".
- Using of a callback-function for each found running process.
- Evaluation of the whole command-line of each found process possible.
- Useful to establish inter process communication.

Excuses my Eric Allman coding-style. ;-)
