# Get Linux-Process IDs
Module for C/C++ to find process-id numbers of current running linux-processes.

- Similar to the shell-command "pidof".
- Using of a callback-function for each found running process.
- Evaluation of the whole command-line of each found process possible.

Excuses my Eric Allman coding-style. ;-)
